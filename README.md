# sign_language_translater
This project is a Real-Time Sign Language Translator that converts American Sign Language (ASL) hand gestures into text and speech using computer vision and machine learning. Designed as an assistive tool for the hearing-impaired, it enables seamless communication by recognizing hand signs and vocalizing them in real time.
